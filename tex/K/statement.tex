You are given an undirected graph $G$ of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges.
The vertices in $G$ are numbered from $1$ to $n$. For each vertex $i$ in $G$, a weight $a_i$ is associated with it.

Given an integer $k$, define a $k$-restricted induced subgraph of $G$ are induced subgraphs satisfying all the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
\item The induced subgraph is connected.
\item For every pair of vertices $u,v$ in the induced subgraph, $|a_u - a_v| \leq k$ should hold. Note that an edge does not necessarily connect $u$ and $v$.
\end{itemize}
What is the maximum possible number of vertices in a $k$-restricted induced subgraph of $G$?
