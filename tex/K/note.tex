An induced subgraph of $G$ is formed by some non-empty subset of vertices $S$ of $G$, and all edges in $G$ such that both endpoints are in $S$.
In this problem, we view $G$ also as an induced subgraph of $G$ itself.

For example, the following are all induced subgraphs of $G$ in Sample Input $2$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Vertices $1,2,6$ with edges $(1,6),(2,6)$
    \item Vertices $1,3,4$ with edge $(1,3)$
    \item Vertex $5$
    \item Vertices $1,2,3,5,6,7$ with edges $(1,3),(1,6),(2,6),(2,3),(6,7),(2,7),(2,5)$
\end{itemize}
