Brian is a fan of the double-sided octopus mascots.
He visits a fair with $n$ stands providing numerous octopus double-sided mascots to collect as many mascots as possible.

The stands in the fair are numbered from $1$ to $n$, and Brian will also visit the stands in this order.
When visiting the $i$-th stand, he can do exactly one of the following (but not both):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pay $a_i$ dollars to obtain $a_i$ tokens. Brian can hold at most $m$ tokens at a time. If Brian earns more than $m$ at any time, the rest of the tokens must be returned to the stand.
    \item Pay $b_i$ tokens to obtain $b_i$ double-sided octopus mascots.
\end{enumerate}
At this moment, Brian has no tokens.
What is the maximum number of double-sided octopus mascots he can receive after visiting the $n$ stands?
You may assume that Brian always has enough money to pay for the tokens.
