Nancy has a huge collection of $n$ positive integers $a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n$. Unfortunately, she is not satisfied since there are duplicate integers in them.

To make Nancy happy, you can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): Select an integer $i$ from $1$ to $n$ (inclusive), and add $1$ to $a_i$. 

What is the minimum number of operations required so that all the integers in $a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n$ are distinct (in other words, all integers are different)?
