There are $n$ points on the Cartesian plane.
The $i$th point has coordinate $(x_i,y_i)$.
No two points concide and no three points are collinear.

Define a \textbf{linear classifier} as a straight line on the Cartesian plane with equation $\frac{q_a}{p_a} x + \frac{q_b}{p_b} y = \frac{q_c}{p_c}$, where $p_a,q_a,p_b,q_b,p_c,q_c$ are integers. 

Let's say we have two linear classifiers.
If the two classifiers have exactly one intersection, they divide the Cartesian plane into $4$ regions.
Can you find two linear classifiers so that each of the $4$ regions contains an equal number of points?
Of course, no points should lie on the linear classifiers, so each region should have exactly $\frac{n}{4}$ points.
