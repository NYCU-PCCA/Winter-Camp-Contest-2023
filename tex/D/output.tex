For each testcase, print an integer $k$ denoting the number of cards given to Laffey in the first line.

$k$ lines follow.
In the $i$-th line, print two integers $x_i,y_i$ denoting the $i$-th operation given to Laffey.

Your solution will be considered correct if it satisfies all the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $0 \leq k \leq n$
    \item $1 \leq x_i < y_i \leq n$ for $i = 1,2,\ldots,k$
    \item When sorted in ascending order, the sequence of operations will sort $a$ in increasing order.
\end{itemize}
If there are multiple possible solutions, print any.
