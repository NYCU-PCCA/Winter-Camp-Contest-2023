Print each test case's a possible value of $n$ and $k$ in one line.
$n$ and $k$ should have the same number of digits as $n'$ and $k'$, respectively.
$n$ and $k$ should not contain leading zeros.

If there are multiple possible solutions, print the one with the minimum $n$.
It is guaranteed that a solution always exists.
