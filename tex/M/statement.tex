Factorizing huge integers has caught more and more people's interest since it is unknown whether fast algorithms to factorize huge integers exist.
Despite the difficulty, Mia challenges you to factorize a huge positive integer $n$.
As a hint, she also gives you $k$, the number of positive factors of $n$.

Soon, you realize that Mia only learns primes less than $100$, so all the prime factors in $n$ are less than $100$.
You also noticed that Mia intentionally miswrote exactly one digit in both $n$ and $k$.
Now you are given $n'$ and $k'$ (the miswritten $n$ and $k$), and you are to find $n$ and $k$ so that you can successfully factorize $n$.
