Shokuhou (食蜂) is a girl who lives in Academy City.
The Academy City comprises $n$ districts numbered $1,2,\ldots,n$.
There are $m$ bidirectional roads between the districts.
The $i$-th road connects city $u_i$ and $v_i$, and traversing it takes exactly $c_i$ minutes.
In addition, each district has a portal; the portal in the $i$-th city has power $a_i$.
With these portals, one can travel from the $i$-th city to the $j$-th city in $a_i+a_j$ minutes for $i=1,2,\ldots,n$ and $j=1,2,\ldots,n$. 

Shokuhou is currently at district $1$, and her home is at district $n$.
Since she learned she had just had a break-in at her house, she would like to return home immediately.
She can go back home using any number of roads and portals.
What is the minimum number of minutes she must spend to return home?
