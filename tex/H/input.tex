The first line contains an integer $n$.

The following $2n$ lines indicate the status of the imprints.
For each $i = 1,2,\cdots,n$, two lines follow, indicating the status of the imprints of the $i$-th layer.
The format for the $i$-th layer is the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Both of the two lines begin with $n-i$ spaces.
\item Exactly $2i$ characters follow the spaces in the first line. Each character represents an imprint. \texttt{\textbackslash} or \texttt{/} denotes a charged imprint, while \texttt{.} denotes an uncharged imprint.
\item Exactly $2i$ characters follow the spaces in the second line. A consecutive pair of characters represents an imprint. \texttt{..} denotes an uncharged imprint, while \texttt{--} denotes a charged imprint.
\end{itemize}

The imprints on the boundary of the relic are guaranteed to be charged.
