Print the maximum possible strength $k$ in the first line.
In the $i$-th line of the following $m$ lines, print two integers $s_i,t_i$ denoting that the team contains $s_i$-th member with $t_i$-th skill.

Your solution will be considered correct if it satisfys all the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item All $t_i$ are distinct.
    \item $\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{m} a_{s_i,t_i} = k$
\end{itemize}
If there are multiple possible solutions, print any.
