Print the maximum possible strength $k$ in the first line.
In the $i$-th line of the following $m$ lines, print two integers $s_i,t_i$ denoting that the team contains $s_i$-th member with $t_i$-th skill.

Your solution will be considered correct if it satisfies all the following conditions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $1 \leq s_i \leq n$ for $i = 1,2,\ldots,n$
    \item $s_i \neq s_j$ for $i \neq j$
    \item $1 \leq t_i \leq m$ for $i = 1,2,\ldots,m$
    \item $t_i \neq t_j$ for $i \neq j$
    \item $\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{m} a_{s_i,t_i} = k$
\end{itemize}
If there are multiple possible solutions, print any.
