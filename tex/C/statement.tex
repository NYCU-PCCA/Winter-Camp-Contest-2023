Carol is a prestigious painter in the PCCA Kingdom.
Unfortunately, she has to spend time in quarantine during the pandemic, so she comes up with the game described below.

At the beginning of the game, she paints a tree with $n$ nodes numbered $1,2,\ldots,n$.
There are $n-1$ edges, $i$-th of which is $(u_i,v_i)$.
She also draws a picture with $n$ squares numbered $1,2,\ldots,n$.
The $i$-th square is colored with color $a_i = i$.

Then she can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
Select an existing edge $(u_i,v_i)$ from the tree, swap the colors in the square $u_i$ and $v_i$ (that is, swap $a_{u_i}$ and $a_{v_i}$) and remove the edge $(u_i,v_i)$ from the tree.

How many different pictures can be painted after performing any number of operations?
Two pictures are considered different if a square $i$ is painted in different colors in the two pictures.
