The first line of the input contains an integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of two integers $n,m$.
Each of the following $n$ lines contains $m$ characters.
For each $i = 1,2,\ldots,n$, the $j$-th character denotes whether there is a jewel in cell $(i,j)$ for $j = 1,2,\ldots,m$. \texttt{\#} denotes a cell containing a jewel, while \texttt{.} denotes a cell not containing a jewel.
It is guaranteed that no two jewels are adjacent.
