For each test case, print $n$ lines containing $m$ characters denoting the configuration of the jewels and the ropes.
The jewel pairs should be as many as possible.

Each character should be one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{\#} denotes a cell with jewels. The places of jewels should be the same as the input.
\item One of \texttt{ABCDEF} denotes a cell with ropes. Refer to the figure in the problem description to know the meaning for each character. In formal:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{A} denotes a cell connecting the cell to the top and to the right.
    \item \texttt{B} denotes a cell connecting the cell to the bottom and to the right.
    \item \texttt{C} denotes a cell connecting the cell to the bottom and to the left.
    \item \texttt{D} denotes a cell connecting the cell to the top and to the left.
    \item \texttt{E} denotes a cell connecting the cell to the top and to the bottom.
    \item \texttt{F} denotes a cell connecting the cell to the left and to the right.
\end{itemize}
\item \texttt{.} denotes a cell with nothing.
\end{itemize}
